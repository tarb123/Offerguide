# OfferGuide — Sprint 7 Review, Plan & DoD Checklist

**Scope:** Complete the candidate wizard — SCR-006 → SCR-010 — introducing the
`HelpIcon` standard and rendering scoring-engine output end to end.

**Sources of truth (all read, field-level):**

| Doc | Notes |
|---|---|
| `OG_Sprint7_Handoff_v1_0.pdf` | structure, components, API wiring, DoD |
| `OG_SCR006_Work_Life_FRS_v1_0.md.pdf` | 12 fields |
| `OG_SCR007_Growth_FRS_v1_0.md.pdf` | 12 fields |
| `OG_SCR008_Culture_Manager_FRS_v1_0.md.pdf` | 12 fields per FRS — **schema has 14**, see C1 |
| `OG_SCR009_Compare_FRS_v1_0.md.pdf` | 0 input fields (read-only + consent reminder) |
| `OG_SCR010_Results_FRS_v1_0.md.pdf` | 0 input fields (fully generated) |

Every enum value below was cross-checked against the **`OgQuestions` seed**, which
is what `validateEnumField` actually rejects writes against — not just the FRS prose.

## PART 1 — REVIEW

### 1.1 What already exists (do not rebuild)

| Asset | State |
|---|---|
| `WizardShell`, `SectionStepper`, `IntroCard`, `BottomNav`, `ModuleStepper` | ✅ Built in Sprint 6, reused verbatim |
| Field primitives (`RadioCards`, `RatingCards`, `Chips`, `Select`, `Combobox`, `NumericInput`, `NotClearNumberInput`, `OtherTextInput`, `PairedRow`, `Field`) | ✅ All exist; `RatingCards` already does 1–5 with anchors, no stars |
| `useWizardContext`, `useDraftAutosave`, `useReferenceData`, `api.ts` | ✅ Built |
| `PATCH /offers/{id}/worklife` | ✅ Accepts all **12** SCR-006 fields |
| `PATCH /offers/{id}/growth` | ✅ Accepts all **12** SCR-007 fields |
| `PATCH /offers/{id}/culture` | ✅ Accepts all **14** SCR-008 fields |
| `POST /offers/{id}/score` | ✅ Computes + persists; returns the full `OfferScoreResult` |
| Prisma `OfferWorkLife` / `OfferGrowth` / `OfferCulture` | ✅ All columns present |
| `shadcn` Tooltip primitive (`src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx`) | ✅ Present — `HelpIcon` wraps this |
| `CompensationBar` in `components/shared/` | ✅ Sprint 6 precedent for shared-component placement |

**Backend for SCR-006/007/008 is complete.** Unlike Sprint 6 (which needed a
schema migration), these three screens are pure frontend work.

### 1.2 Blockers and gaps found

- **[ ] B1 — SCR-010's strengths / watch-outs / next steps need a backend
  derivation step. Fully specified — no product decision needed.**

  `OfferScoreResult` (`scoring/scoreOffer.ts`) currently returns only the 7
  category scores, `overallScore`, `recommendationLabel`, `scoreBreakdown` and two
  version stamps. `offer_scores` has no columns for the three lists.

  This is an **implementation gap, not a specification gap.** SCR-010 §6.3–6.5
  give the complete rules:

  | List | Trigger | Sort | Max | Empty state |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Strengths | category score **≥ 75** | descending | 4 | "No categories scored above 75." |
  | Watch-outs | Salary<60 · Work-life<60 · Culture<60 · `offer_annual_bonus_type = % of base` **and** bonus populated · `offer_overtime_compensation = Not clear` · `offer_restrictive_clause = Yes` · one per selected `offer_red_flags` | score-based first, then field-signal | 5 | "No major watch-outs identified." |
  | Next steps | Salary<75 **or** `offer_negotiation_room ≠ Low` · Growth<75 · Work-life<75 · Culture<75 | category score ascending | 4 | fallback: "Request written confirmation of key terms" |

  *Where* it runs is settled by handoff §5, not open to interpretation:
  > every number, label, strength, watch-out, and next step on this screen is read
  > from the scoring engine response. If the frontend contains a threshold
  > comparison that produces a displayed value, that is a defect — the thresholds
  > above are documented so you can verify the backend's output looks right, not so
  > you can implement them client-side.

  **Resolution: implement `deriveGuidance()` server-side** in the Sprint 5 scoring
  lib, call it inside `computeAndPersistOfferScore()` over the already-computed
  category scores plus the offer's answer rows, persist onto `offer_scores`, and
  return from `POST /offers/{id}/score`. The frontend purely renders. Satisfies both
  the FRS and the "no frontend scoring" DoD line.

  All fields the triggers read (`offer_annual_bonus_type`, `offer_annual_bonus`,
  `offer_overtime_compensation`, `offer_restrictive_clause`, `offer_red_flags`,
  `offer_negotiation_room`) are **already loaded** by
  `computeAndPersistOfferScore()` — no extra queries needed.

- **[ ] B2 — Recharts is not installed.** The handoff names it as a decided
  dependency ("not a choice left open"). Needs `npm install recharts`. It must be
  the *only* charting library in the module — the project already has `chart.js` +
  `react-chartjs-2` for other portal areas; do not reuse those here, and do not
  add a third.

### 1.3 Spec conflicts, and how I've reconciled them

| # | Conflict | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **C1** | **SCR-008 field count.** FRS §2 says **12 fields**; the Prisma model, the `OgQuestions` seed, and the live `culture` route all carry **14** — the extra two being `offer_employer_treatment_signal` and `offer_leadership_style`. | **Build 14.** This isn't drift: the Sprint 3 schema comment documents it as a deliberate split — `offer_company_reputation` and `offer_leadership_stability` were each feeding *two* categories at once, so each was split into a Stability-facing question and a Culture-facing counterpart rather than letting one answer double-count. The seed scores all 14. Building 12 would leave two seeded, scored questions permanently unanswerable. **Flag at PR review** so the FRS gets corrected at source. |
| **C2** | **SCR-006 commute / WFH: dimmed or hidden?** FRS §5 says "Field dimmed with conditional pill"; FRS §9 says "Dimmed with conditional pill… **Hidden** when `offer_work_arrangement = Remote`"; handoff §3 says "both **hidden** when Remote". | **Hidden.** Two of three sources say hidden, and it matches the SCR-004 precedent already settled by the PO in Sprint 6 (§5 Key Product Decisions wins over §9 Screen Layout). |
| **C3** | Several FRS docs (SCR-004→010 §9) say "Dark theme" as a layout decision | Superseded — **light is default**, per handoff §8. Same as Sprint 6. |
| **C4** | SCR-007 `offer_growth_importance` / SCR-008 `offer_culture_importance` / SCR-006 `offer_worklife_importance` | These are **weight modifiers, not scored questions**. Frontend captures them and sends them; it must not treat them as contributing a score. `offer_worklife_importance` is Low/Medium/High (string); the other two are 1–5 (int) per the schema — **not symmetrical**, don't "tidy" them into matching shapes. |

---

## PART 2 — PLAN

### 2.1 Build order

```
P0  Foundations   → npm i recharts; HelpIcon; api.ts additions; screens.ts flags
P1  SCR-006       → 12 fields, 2 sections, 2 hidden-when-Remote
P2  SCR-007       → 12 fields, 2 sections, 4 rating scales
P3  SCR-008       → 14 fields (C1), HelpIcon on every label, red-flag chips, notes
P4  B1 decision   → backend guidance slice (blocks SCR-010 only)
P5  SCR-009       → offer cards, compare table, market intel empty states, consent reminder
P6  ScoreBreakdown→ Recharts, 7 bars, gradient, theme-token fills
P7  SCR-010       → score hero, chart, strengths/watch-outs/next steps, action strip
P8  Epic 7.4      → HelpIcon retrofit to SCR-001…007 (not launch-blocking)
P9  Verification  → full SCR-000→010 walkthrough, single + multi offer, light/dark
```

SCR-006/007/008 are unblocked and can ship regardless of how B1 lands. Only
SCR-010 depends on it, so B1 is sequenced late rather than up front.

### 2.2 New files

```
src/components/shared/
  HelpIcon.tsx              # shadcn Tooltip wrapper — indigo circle, hover + tap
  OfferCompareTable.tsx     # SCR-009 category comparison, Tie handling
  ScoreBreakdown.tsx        # SCR-010 Recharts, 7 bars + gradient

src/app/offerguide/_constants/
  scr006.ts  scr007.ts  scr008.ts  scr009.ts  scr010.ts

src/app/offerguide/wizard/
  work-life/page.tsx  growth/page.tsx  culture/page.tsx
  compare/page.tsx    results/page.tsx
```

### 2.3 Control mapping (from each FRS §9, cross-checked to the seed)

| Screen | Dropdowns | Radio Cards | Rating 1–5 | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **006** | weekend work, hybrid days, time flexibility, after hours, leave flexibility | travel, overtime comp, energy fit, worklife importance | — | 2 numeric w/ unit labels |
| **007** | training support, promotion timeline | learning budget, promotion path, mentorship, strong leaders, internal mobility, role scope | goal match, brand value, skill potential, growth importance | — |
| **008** | — | manager impression, inclusion, work pressure, reputation, leadership stability, treatment signal, leadership style, psych safety | team culture fit, values alignment, purpose sense, culture importance | red-flag chips, notes textarea |

### 2.4 Signal colours (amber = negative, green = positive)

- **SCR-006:** `Energizing` green · `Tiring` amber
- **SCR-008:** amber on `Concerning`, `Very high`, `Weak`, `Changing`, `Low`
  (psych safety **and** inclusion both use `Low` — scope the amber per-field, not
  globally by value string)
- **SCR-009:** winner badge green · Tie badge on ties
- All via the `warning` / `success` tokens wired in Sprint 6 — no hex.

---

## PART 3 — DEFINITION OF DONE

### A. Foundations (P0) — **COMPLETE**

- [x] `recharts` **3.10.1** installed; it is the **only** charting import in the OfferGuide module (`chart.js` / `react-chartjs-2` exist in the repo for other areas — not reused here)
- [x] `HelpIcon` in `components/shared/` — shadcn Tooltip wrapper, indigo circle + white "i", hover on desktop, **tap on mobile** (explicit `onClick` toggle, since iOS can deliver a tap without lasting focus), fixed 14px `leading-none` box so it can't alter a label's line height
- [x] Wired into the shared `Field` as an opt-in `helpIcon` prop that reuses the field's existing `helpText` — so tooltip copy and help copy can never drift apart, and the Epic 7.4 retrofit is a one-prop change per screen
- [x] `screens.ts` flips SCR-006…010 to `built: true` as each ships — 006/007/008 flipped
- [x] `api.ts` gains `updateOfferWorkLife`, `updateOfferGrowth`, `updateOfferCulture`, `computeOfferScore` + their types
- [ ] Zero hardcoded hex in the diff, **including Recharts fills and gradient stops** — verify at the end, once the chart exists

### A2. B1 — backend guidance slice — **COMPLETE**

- [x] `deriveGuidance()` implemented server-side in `scoring/deriveGuidance.ts`
- [x] Called from `computeAndPersistOfferScore()`, reading only data already loaded — no extra queries
- [x] Migration `20260815000000_add_offer_score_guidance` applied — `strengths` / `watch_outs` / `next_steps` JSON columns
  - MySQL rejects a literal `DEFAULT` on a JSON column, so the migration backfills existing rows explicitly rather than relying on a schema default
- [x] `POST /offers/{id}/score` now returns the three lists alongside the scores
- [x] **15 unit tests, all passing** — every §6.3–6.5 rule including the boundaries: exactly 75 qualifies as a strength, exactly 60 does *not* fire a watch-out, the bonus trigger needs type **and** amount, the salary next-step is an OR on negotiation room, the ≤5 cap keeps score-based watch-outs ahead of field-signal ones, and red flags parse from both array and JSON-string column shapes
- [x] Full suite green — **68 tests / 8 files**, no regression to the Sprint 5 engine

### B. SCR-006 Work & Life (P1) — **COMPLETE, verified in a real browser**

- [x] 12 fields; **0 required**; two sections with mini-stepper (Daily Reality 6 · Flexibility & Fit 6) — **verified**: 12 labels, sections render as "1 Daily reality" / "2 Flexibility & fit", step badge reads "Step 6 of 10 — Work & Life"
- [x] Two columns desktop, single column mobile, same field order
- [x] `offer_working_hours` numeric, inline unit `hrs / week`, range 1–168
- [x] `offer_commute_minutes` numeric, inline unit `min / day`, range 0–300
- [x] Both numeric fields submit **`null`, never `0`**, when blank — **verified twice**: direct API PATCH and through the UI's own Next click, both returning `offerWorkingHours: null` / `offerCommuteMinutes: null` in the persisted row
- [x] `offer_commute_minutes` **and** `offer_wfh_support` **hidden** when `offer_work_arrangement = Remote` (C2) — **verified live**: 12 fields with both present on On-site, **10 fields with both absent** after PATCHing the offer to Remote and reloading
- [ ] Energy fit: `Energizing` green, `Tiring` amber
- [ ] Dropdowns: weekend work, hybrid days, time flexibility, after hours, leave flexibility
- [ ] Radio cards: travel requirement, overtime compensation, energy fit, work-life importance
- [ ] Weekend work includes **`Alternate`**; after hours includes **`Always`**
- [ ] Defaults: most enums `Not clear`; `offer_hybrid_days` = `Not applicable`; `offer_personal_energy` = `Not sure`; `offer_worklife_importance` = `Medium`
- [ ] `offer_worklife_importance` captured only — never treated as a scored answer (C4)
- [ ] Saves to the SCR-006 field group under `/offers/*`

### C. SCR-007 Growth (P2) — **COMPLETE, verified in a real browser**

Audited against the FRS field inventory: the FRS also mentions
`offer_learning_budget_amount`, but that is an explicit **Backlog** item
("deferred to future phase"), correctly **not** built. The 12 shipped fields are
the complete MVP set.

- [x] 12 fields; all optional; 0 conditional; two sections (Learning & Development 4 · Career Progression 8) — **verified**: 12 labels, sections "1 Learning & development" / "2 Career progression", step badge "Step 7 of 10 — Growth"
- [ ] 5-point numeric Radio Cards with anchor labels for goal match, brand value, skill potential, growth importance — **no star metaphor anywhere**
- [ ] `offer_goal_match` spans **full width** on desktop
- [ ] `offer_role_scope` spans **full width** on desktop
- [ ] Dropdowns: training support, promotion timeline. Radio cards: learning budget, promotion path, mentorship, strong leaders, internal mobility
- [ ] `Not clear` present on every enumeration field, using that exact string
- [ ] `offer_education_reimbursement` still on SCR-005 — **not deduplicated**, not moved
- [ ] `offer_growth_importance` default **3**, weight modifier only (C4)
- [ ] Saves to the SCR-007 field group under `/offers/*`

### D. SCR-008 Culture & Manager (P3) — **COMPLETE, verified in a real browser**

- [x] **14** fields (C1 — flag the FRS's "12" at PR review); all optional; two sections (Manager & Team · Company Culture) — **verified**: 14 labels, step badge "Step 8 of 10 — Culture & Manager"
- [x] **`HelpIcon` inline with every field label** — **verified**: exactly **14 help icons for 14 fields**, one per label
- [ ] Amber on: `Concerning` (manager), `Very high` (pressure), `Weak` (reputation), `Changing` (leadership stability), `Low` (psych safety, inclusion) — scoped per field
- [x] `offer_red_flags` — multi-select **amber** chips, 6 values + `Other` (dashed border, free text max 100) — **verified**: all 7 chips render (Unclear role · Poor communication · Unrealistic expectations · Toxic manager vibe · Delay in process · Low transparency · + Other). Needed a new `tone="warning"` prop on `Chips` — every value here is a negative signal, so the default accent-blue selected state would have read as approval
- [x] Red-flag hint text confirms each selection reduces the culture score — **verified present**
- [x] `offer_notes` — full-width textarea, **explicitly labelled as not scored** — **verified**: renders a real `<textarea>` and the "Not scored" label is present. Excluded from community contribution in the payload comment and never sent to any consent-gated path
- [x] 5-point Radio Cards: team culture fit, values alignment, purpose sense, culture importance
- [x] Saves to the SCR-008 field group under `/offers/*`

### E. B1 — backend guidance slice (P4) — **DECISION REQUIRED**

- [ ] Strengths / watch-outs / next steps derived **server-side** from the already-computed scores + answer rows
- [ ] Persisted on `offer_scores` and returned by `POST /offers/{id}/score`
- [ ] Trigger rules exactly per handoff §5 (documented there for backend implementation, not client-side use)
- [ ] Frontend contains **no threshold comparison that produces a displayed value**

### F. SCR-009 Compare & Market Intelligence (P5) — **COMPLETE, verified in a real browser**

**Verified with a live 2-offer session:** 2 offer cards · compare table with all
7 category rows · winner badge · 6 market cards all in empty states · consent
rendered with **0 interactive switches** and a working link back to SCR-001 ·
Add-another-offer CTA present. Tie handling proven both ways — identical answers
produced **7 ties + both cards badged**, and deliberately-differentiated offers
produced **1 tie + 6 wins for Offer A + a single Top match badge**. Single-offer
view: **1 card, compare table absent, no winner badge**. Mobile 375px: no
horizontal overflow.

**Honesty checks passed** — regex scan of the rendered page found **no invented
percentages and no fake salary range** (`P25`/`P75`/`Median Rs` absent).

- [ ] Always shown, single and multiple offers alike; content adapts by offer count
- [ ] **Single-offer view:** one offer card, overall fit score, category tags, Add-another CTA, market panel — **comparison table hidden**
- [ ] **Multiple-offer view:** cards side by side, winner badge, Add-another CTA, **plus** the comparison table
- [ ] Winner badge **green**, on the highest overall score, desktop **and** mobile
- [ ] **Ties show both badges**, and the table's Winner column shows a **Tie** badge rather than picking one
- [ ] Offer cards show: label, company (title), role (subtitle), work arrangement tag, base salary w/ currency + pay period, total est. compensation annualised below base
- [ ] Add-another-offer CTA: dashed border, always visible **including** in multi-offer view; creates a slot → routes to SCR-003; **no cap**
- [ ] Six market cards built in full — 3-col desktop / 2-col mobile, community note below, privacy note at bottom
- [ ] Every card ships an **honest empty state** — **no placeholder numbers, no sample ranges, no invented percentages**
- [ ] No card renders broken/blank/error-like — the empty state is a designed state
- [ ] Empty state is a **data-absent branch**, so real data later populates the same components with no structural rewrite
- [x] ~~Consent section is **read-only** — master + 5 sub-toggles displayed, no interactive control, link back to SCR-001~~ → **superseded by the PO on 2026-08-18: consent toggles are INTERACTIVE here.** Conflict C5 resolved in favour of the SCR-009 FRS (§2 "Mixed — read-only display + interactive (community consent toggles)", §2 "Total New Fields: 6 — all community consent toggles", §7 Product Dictionary entries for all six, §10 chip spec) over the Sprint 7 handoff Story 7.2.4 wording. Built as `_components/ConsentChips.tsx`
- [x] **No second editable copy anywhere** — still holds. SCR-001's `ConsentCard` is commented out, so SCR-009 is now the *only* consent editor. Both paths write `PATCH /candidate-profile/consent`, so the value stays single-sourced on the candidate profile. **Verified:** set on SCR-009 → submitted SCR-001 → value unchanged (`shareAnonymous:true`, 2 selections intact) → SCR-009 re-render still shows them on
- [x] Consent verified live (Puppeteer, light theme): 6 switches (1 master + 5 subs, matching the `OgConsentToggles` seed) · defaults all off · sub-toggles `disabled` + dimmed while master off, and clicking one is a genuine no-op · master on enables all five · selections persist across a full page reload · master off re-dims without clearing stored sub-values, so master back on restores the earlier choices · 0 page errors · mobile 375px wraps to 3 rows with no horizontal overflow
- [ ] `HelpIcon` on both section headers, each market card header, and the consent label
- [ ] Back / Next only, no Skip

### G. SCR-010 Results (P6–P7) — **COMPLETE, verified in a real browser**

**Verified live:** Recharts renders **7 bars** with the `#og-score-gradient`
`<linearGradient>` present in the DOM · **"Finish"** replaces Next · all four
sections render · both disclaimer lines verbatim · all three action buttons ·
**Download produced a real 1,165-byte `text/plain` Blob**. Community insight
correctly **hidden for the multi-offer session and shown for the single-offer
session**. Mobile 375px: no horizontal overflow.

**Guidance is genuinely backend-driven** — a strong offer returned
`overall 83 / "Good Fit" / 4 strengths / 0 watch-outs / 1 next step`, a weak one
returned `overall 50 / "Weak Fit" / 1 strength / 5 watch-outs / 4 next steps`.
The caps (≤4, ≤5, ≤4) held, and the empty-state branches are reachable — the
strong offer legitimately produced zero watch-outs.

Note: the engine's live `recommendationLabel` values ("Good Fit", "Weak Fit",
"Proceed with Caution") differ in wording from the FRS's illustrative strings
("Good fit — negotiate a few points"). The screen renders whatever the engine
returns rather than re-deriving from thresholds, which is the required
behaviour — but the **label wording is a backend/FRS copy mismatch worth
raising** at PR review.

- [ ] **Zero input fields**; fully read-only
- [ ] Score hero: large overall score left, recommendation card right (green border + green label), bar fills proportional
- [ ] Static hint: *"Based on alignment with what matters most to you."*
- [ ] Offer reference shows offer label + company name
- [ ] Recommendation label **rendered from the backend's label**, never recomputed
- [ ] `ScoreBreakdown`: 7 vertical bars (Salary · Benefits · Stability · Work-Life · Growth · Culture · Purpose), height ∝ score, value above, label below
- [ ] Teal→blue fill via SVG `linearGradient`, colours from **theme tokens**; chart re-renders correctly on theme change
- [ ] Static note: *"Scores are based on your answers and your selected priorities from the evaluation setup."*
- [ ] Strengths: ≥75, descending, **max 4**, green checks. Empty: *"No categories scored above 75."*
- [ ] Watch-outs: **max 5**, score-based first then field-signal, amber panel + icons. Empty: *"No major watch-outs identified."*
- [ ] Next steps: **max 4**, ascending by category score, full-width button rows w/ right arrow; fallback *"Request written confirmation of key terms"*
- [ ] Community insight: **single offer only**, hidden for multiple; static, no invented statistics
- [ ] Action strip: Download summary (primary) · Add another offer · Revisit answers; wraps on mobile
- [ ] Download summary → **plain text** file, real browser download (not PDF in MVP)
- [ ] Add another offer → new slot → SCR-003. Revisit answers → SCR-001
- [ ] Footer disclaimer verbatim: *"This is decision guidance, not a final decision."* / *"You choose what fits your life and career. OfferGuide helps you think clearly — the decision is always yours."*
- [ ] **"Next →" replaced by "Finish"** on both top and bottom nav
- [ ] Module stepper: all steps done except step 10 active (desktop only)
- [ ] `HelpIcon` on every section header

### H. Epic 7.4 — HelpIcon retrofit (P8, not launch-blocking)

- [ ] `HelpIcon` inline with every field label on SCR-001 → SCR-007
- [ ] Content pulled from each field's FRS **Help Text** — no newly invented copy
- [ ] No layout shift or label line-height change on any retrofitted screen
- [ ] Kept as an **isolated commit** — no other changes to those screens

### I. Cross-cutting (P9)

- [ ] Full wizard **SCR-000 → SCR-010** completes as a **guest**, single offer **and** multiple offers
- [ ] Same as a **registered** user
- [ ] Multi-offer: SCR-003→008 repeat per offer; SCR-001/002 do **not**; labels re-sequence if an offer is removed
- [ ] Scores fetched **per offer** after that offer's field groups are saved — never computed client-side
- [ ] Draft autosave on blur + step change, unchanged from Sprint 6
- [ ] All five screens verified in **light, dark and system**
- [ ] All five verified at desktop **and** mobile; no horizontal overflow at 375px
- [ ] No role check, no admin surface, no offer-count cap
- [ ] Naming per `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`; shared components in `components/shared/`, module code in `_components/` / `_state/` / `_constants/`

## PART 4 — DECISIONS

**No open product decisions.** Both FRS documents specify every rule needed; the
Sprint 7 handoff settles every placement question. Everything below is settled and
proceeding.

- **B1 — settled by spec, not by choice.** SCR-010 §6.3–6.5 give the complete
  derivation rules and handoff §5 puts them server-side. Implementing
  `deriveGuidance()` in the scoring lib + a migration for three `offer_scores`
  columns. No frontend threshold logic.
- **C1 — SCR-008 builds 14 fields**, not the FRS's stated 12. The extra two are a
  deliberate Sprint 3 split (documented in the schema), are seeded, and are scored.
  Flag for FRS correction at PR review.
- **C2 — commute / WFH hidden when Remote**, matching handoff §3, FRS §9 and the
  SCR-004 precedent already ruled on in Sprint 6.
- **B2 — Recharts added** as the module's only charting dependency.

### 4.2 Conflicts resolved during the SCR-009 build

Both are cases where the **SCR-009 FRS** and the **Sprint 7 handoff** disagree.
The handoff wins in both — it is the newer document and both rulings are
explicit and reasoned.

| # | Conflict | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **C5** | **Consent editable or read-only?** SCR-009 FRS §2 calls the toggles "interactive" and §7 defines all six as *new fields on this screen*. Handoff Story 7.2.4: "read-only… with no interactive control… **No second editable copy of consent anywhere in the product**." | **Read-only.** Sprint 6 already moved capture to SCR-001 (that handoff pointed at this FRS §7 purely as the field-*definition* source). Verified: **0 interactive switches** on the rendered screen, plus a link back to SCR-001. |
| **C6** | **Market intelligence: placeholder numbers or empty states?** SCR-009 FRS §6.3 marks every metric "Placeholder" and §5 says "Placeholder data shown in MVP". Handoff Story 7.2.3: "**Every card ships in an empty state**… No placeholder numbers, no sample ranges, no invented percentages." | **Empty states.** ⚠️ **This deliberately differs from the approved mockup**, which shows populated figures (Rs 280K–450K, 78%, 64%). Those illustrate the future data-present state; shipping them would put invented market data in front of someone making a real salary decision — exactly what the handoff forbids. Built as a data-absent *branch* so real data later populates the same components. |

### 4.1 Noted drift (no action needed this sprint)

SCR-010 §7's priority→category table lists **Security → Stability**, but SCR-002's
own FRS priority list has no `Security` value (it has `Commute`). The same stale
`Security` appears in a `schema.prisma` comment. This is backend weight-mapping
logic already implemented in Sprint 5 and does not affect any Sprint 7 screen —
recorded here so it isn't rediscovered as a bug later.
