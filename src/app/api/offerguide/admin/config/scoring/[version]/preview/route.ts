// GET /admin/config/scoring/{version}/preview — Sprint 10, Epic 10.2.6.
//
// Scores the five golden fixtures under the CURRENTLY ACTIVE config and under
// the target {version}, side by side, so an admin sees what activating the
// target would do to representative offers before committing. Read-only — it
// never calls persistOfferScore and never writes an OfferScore row, which is
// why it is a GET despite doing real computation (it mirrors GET /score, a pure
// read, not POST /compute-score, a write).
//
// scoreOffer() is a pure function, but the questions, benchmarks and both config
// versions it needs live in Mongo — so this has to be a server endpoint, not a
// client-side computation as the original plan's wording implied.
//
// Works for ANY version, not just drafts: re-activating an older version gets
// the same preview, since there is no separate "rollback" mode (per the FRS).
//
// The endpoint returns both scored results per fixture; the client computes the
// deltas it renders.
//
// FIXTURE SET — a deliberate reading of the plan's "five fixtures A–E".
// GOLDEN_FIXTURES is the four SINGLE-OFFER fixtures (A strong, B weak, C high-
// uncertainty, D minimum-viable). The plan's fifth, E, is MULTI_OFFER_FIXTURE —
// a comparison of two offers that REUSES A and B, exercising winner/tie logic
// rather than any new single-offer scoring. Its per-offer scores under each
// config are therefore already shown as the A and B rows; there is no separate
// number to score for E. Previewing the four single-offer fixtures is the whole
// of the config's scoring impact. (If E's winner/tie outcome ever needs its own
// row, that is a small follow-up on top of these results.)
