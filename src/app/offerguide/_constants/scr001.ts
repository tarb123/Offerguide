/**
 * SCR-001 Candidate Profile — allowed values, defaults and copy.
 *
 * Every list, default and help string below is transcribed from the
 * OG_SCR001 Product Dictionary. 24 fields: 2 required (career_stage,
 * preferred_work_arrangement), 18 optional, 4 conditional.
 *
 * Unlike the offer screens, these fields are NOT in the OgQuestions collection —
 * the seed only covers scored offer_* fields on SCR-003 onward — so nothing
 * server-side validates these strings. That makes this file the only guard against
 * drift, which is exactly why the values live here as data rather than inline in
 * JSX.
 *
 * Terminology (Product Discovery §3.1) is reproduced literally, never paraphrased:
 * "Not clear" = the fact exists and the candidate doesn't know it. "Not sure" =
 * subjective and genuinely uncertain. "Not applicable" = structurally irrelevant.
