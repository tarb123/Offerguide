/**
 * SCR-009 Compare & Market Intelligence — 0 data-entry fields.
 *
 * TWO CONFLICTS between this screen's FRS and the Sprint 7 handoff. The handoff
 * wins in both cases — it is the newer document and both rulings are explicit.
 *
 * 1. CONSENT — editable or read-only?
 *    SCR-009 FRS §2 calls the consent toggles "interactive" and §7 defines all
 *    six as new fields on this screen. But Sprint 6 already MOVED consent
 *    capture to SCR-001 (that handoff said so, and pointed at this FRS §7 purely
 *    as the field-definition source). Sprint 7 handoff Story 7.2.4 then states:
 *    "SCR-009 shows it back to the candidate and nothing more... read-only...
 *    with no interactive control... No second editable copy of consent anywhere
 *    in the product."
 *    → Built READ-ONLY, with a link back to SCR-001.
 *
 * 2. MARKET INTELLIGENCE — placeholder numbers or empty states?
 *    SCR-009 FRS §6.3 marks every metric "Placeholder" and §5 says "Placeholder
 *    data shown in MVP". Sprint 7 handoff Story 7.2.3 overrides that outright:
 *    "There is no benchmark data at launch. Every card ships in an empty
 *    state... No placeholder numbers, no sample ranges, no invented
 *    percentages. A candidate evaluating a real offer must not see a figure
 *    that looks like market data but isn't."
 *    → Built as honest EMPTY STATES. The approved mockup shows populated
 *      figures, but that illustrates the future data-present state; shipping
 *      those numbers would put invented market data in front of someone making
 *      a real salary decision.
 *    Each card is a data-absent BRANCH of the same component, so real community
 *    data later populates it with no structural rewrite.

 *
 * NOTE ON THE CONFLICT: Sprint 7 handoff Story 7.2.3 says the opposite — empty
 * states only, "no placeholder numbers, no sample ranges, no invented
 * percentages", on the grounds that a candidate evaluating a real offer must
 * not see a figure that looks like market data but isn't. The Product Owner
 * chose the FRS/mockup behaviour, so these ship — but carrying
 * `isSampleData: true`, which renders a visible "Sample data" badge on the
 * panel. That keeps the screen looking complete (the FRS's intent) without any
 * chance of the numbers being mistaken for real benchmarks (the handoff's
 * concern). Removing the badge is a one-line change if the PO prefers.
 *
 * There is no benchmark data at launch, so nothing real can populate this yet;
 * swap this constant for the API payload when the community pool exists.
