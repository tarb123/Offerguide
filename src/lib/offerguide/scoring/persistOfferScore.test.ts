// Sprint 10, Epic 10.7 — persistOfferScore's answer wiring.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `persistOfferScore.ts` had zero test coverage, and that
// is exactly how a live scoring bug survived: its `answerSources` array listed
// the four sub-models and never the base `Offer` row, so `offer_employment_type`
// and `offer_probation` — both Stability, both on `offers` itself — were
// structurally invisible to `flattenAnswers()` and always fell through to
// `nullScore`. Every candidate's Stability score ignored what they answered.
//
// `scoreOffer.test.ts` and `categoryScore.test.ts` did not catch it because they
// hand-build their answer objects and happen to include those two fields
// directly, which bypasses the wiring under test here.
//
// So these tests mock the two DATABASES but run the REAL
// `computeAndPersistOfferScore`, using the real seed questions and the real
// active scoring config. Delete `offerBaseFields` from `answerSources` and this
// file goes red — that is its entire job.
