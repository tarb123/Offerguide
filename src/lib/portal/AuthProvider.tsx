/**
 * The portal's single client-side source of identity (Sprint 9, Story 9.1.2).
 *
 * NO NEW localStorage KEY, per NAMING_CONVENTIONS §10 and the sprint DoD. The
 * portal JWT lives in an httpOnly `portalToken` cookie, which script cannot
 * read by design, so identity comes from `GET /api/auth/session` instead. The
 * existing `authToken` localStorage copy is left exactly as it was — nothing
 * here reads or writes it.
 *
 * ================== WHY IT STARTS AS A GUEST ==================
 *
 * The first render is always the public tier, then it resolves. That direction
 * is deliberate and it satisfies the DoD criterion as written:
 *
 *   "A guest must never briefly see admin or authenticated links before the
 *    client resolves identity."
 *
 * Starting public makes that impossible — a guest's nav never contains a
 * higher-tier item at any point. What an ADMIN sees is their extra links
 * appearing a moment after load, which is the opposite, safe direction.
 *
 * The alternative was reading the cookie in the root layout so the server could
 * render the right tier immediately. That was rejected: the root layout wraps
 * every page in the portal, and calling `cookies()` there opts the ENTIRE site
 * out of static rendering — a time-to-first-byte cost paid by every visitor,
 * the overwhelming majority of whom are guests who would see identical output.
 * Trading that for a brief nav expansion seen only by signed-in users is a bad
 * bargain.
 *
 * It also fails safe: if the session request never completes, the nav stays
 * public rather than breaking.
 *
 * If a future admin dashboard makes instant tier resolution matter more than
 * static rendering, the switch is to read the cookie in a server component and
 * pass `initialIdentity` in — this provider already accepts it.
 *
 * ==============================================================
 *
 * SCOPE: this covers the MySQL `sanjeedausers` account only. The pgp modules
 * (candidate / mentor / management) authenticate against separate Mongo
 * collections with their own JWTs and their own `role` field, and are NOT
 * represented here. Unifying the two identity systems is a backlog item, not
 * something this provider quietly pretends to have done.
