/**
 * The portal's navigation, declared once (Sprint 9, Story 9.2.1).
 *
 * VISIBILITY IS DATA, NOT BRANCHING. Each entry names the permission it needs;
 * the nav renders whatever survives filtering that through the caller's
 * permission set. There is no `if (role === ...)` in any nav component, and
 * permissions.test.ts asserts that no such comparison exists anywhere in src/.
 * Adding an admin-only destination is a line in this file.
 *
 * ONE DECLARATION, EVERY SURFACE. `ModernHeader` renders the same filtered list
 * twice — the desktop bar and the mobile drawer — and both read from here. It
 * used to hold two hardcoded arrays and render each of them twice, which is how
 * a link ends up in one menu and not the other.
 *
 * WHY `offerguide.wizard.use` GATES PUBLIC LINKS. It reads oddly to gate links
 * everyone can see, but the alternative — an `always visible` escape hatch — is
 * the thing that erodes. Every entry naming a permission means every new entry
 * has to answer "who is this for?", and the public tier holds
 * `offerguide.wizard.use`, so guests see them.
 *
 * ============ THE OFFERGUIDE ENTRY IS PER-DEPLOYMENT ============
 *
 * One codebase serves two domains:
 *
 *   sanjeeda.io       the main portal — must NOT advertise OfferGuide
 *   og.sanjeeda.io    the OfferGuide site — must advertise it
 *
 * That used to be handled by keeping a whole branch (`v2-no-offerguide-link`)
 * permanently different by exactly these few lines, which meant every change had
 * to be merged twice forever and the branches silently drifted. It is now a
 * build-time flag instead, so the branches can converge:
 *
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_OFFERGUIDE=true    advertise it (set on og.sanjeeda.io)
 *   anything else / unset               hide it      (the default)
 *
 * DEFAULTING TO HIDDEN IS DELIBERATE. Forgetting the flag on og.sanjeeda.io
 * costs a missing link that anyone using the site notices immediately.
 * Forgetting it the other way would put the tab back on the main portal — the
 * exact thing this is here to prevent — and nobody would notice until someone
 * looked. The failure modes are not symmetric, so the default guards the one
 * that matters.
 *
 * This only controls whether the header ADVERTISES OfferGuide. `/offerguide`
 * stays a public route on both domains, reachable by URL and by direct link.
 *
