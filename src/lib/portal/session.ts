/**
 * The portal's client-side session, in one place (Sprint 9, Phase 0).
 *
 * Before this file the portal had two storage keys for one JWT — `authToken`
 * written by the auth page and `token` written by GoogleLoginButton — and read
 * neither of them. It also had no logout: the token was written on login and
 * left in localStorage forever.
 *
 * The server-side half of the session is the httpOnly `portalToken` cookie set
 * by `POST /api/auth` (see `lib/offerguide/identity.ts`). That cookie is what
 * middleware and server rendering actually read. The localStorage copy exists
 * for client code that needs to attach an explicit `Authorization` header, and
 * is deliberately kept in sync with it rather than replacing it.
 *
 * NAMING: `authToken` is kept as the key because it is the one the auth page
 * already wrote — changing it would silently log out everyone holding the old
 * key on deploy, for no gain.
