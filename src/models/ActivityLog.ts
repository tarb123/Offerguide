/**
 * Immutable audit trail the admin's Monitoring tab reads. One row per change,
 * newest first, so management can see exactly what happened, when, and what
 * it was before.
 *
 * Two kinds of row share this collection:
 *
 *   program item   a mentor marking a weekly session / capstone / portfolio
 *                  item (`section` is the program field name, `programId` set)
 *   account        the mentor account lifecycle — signup lands as Pending,
 *                  the admin moves it to Active (`section: "account"`, no
 *                  program). This is what gives Monitoring the mentor's signup
 *                  date and activation date as two dated rows.
 *
 * Defined once, re-registered on every evaluation, for the same reason as
 * MentorUser: the first compiled schema otherwise wins for the whole process.
